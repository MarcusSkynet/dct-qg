# DCT-QG: A Unified Framework for Quantum Gravity and Cosmology
## A Principle of Dynamic Dimensionality

This repository contains the foundational documents for **Dimensional Collapse Theory (DCT-QG)**, a comprehensive and falsifiable framework for quantum gravity.

### The Core Premise

The central postulate of this framework is that **spacetime dimensionality is not a fixed constant, but a local, dynamic quantity.**

We propose that when the local geometry reaches a critical, universal curvature threshold, spacetime undergoes a phase transition, reducing its dimensionality by two (`D -> D-2`). This "geometric snap" replaces the classical singularity with a finite, 2-dimensional boundary—the "Ledger"—which acts as a physical repository for information.

From this single premise, using only the established principles of General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and Thermodynamics, a coherent theory emerges that offers:
*   A physical resolution to the **black hole singularity** and the **Information Paradox**.
*   A unified origin for the **dark sector**, with dark matter as Planck-scale ledger remnants and dark energy as the thermodynamic "hum" of the cosmological horizon.
*   A set of concrete, testable predictions, most notably **gravitational wave echoes** with a specific signature.

This framework requires no new particles or ad-hoc physics.

### Contained in this Repository

This repository hosts the **Priority Compilation**, a high-level technical document that serves as the definitive charter for the DCT-QG framework.

*   **[`Priority_Manifest_v1.1.pdf`](Priority_Manifest_v1.1.pdf):** The primary document. This is a dense, expert-level summary of the core postulates, key equations, and phenomenological predictions of the theory. Its purpose is to establish priority and provide a single, comprehensive reference.
*   **[`Priority_Manifest_v1.1.tex`](Priority_Manifest_v1.1.tex):** The LaTeX source code for the manifest.

### Publication Roadmap

This manifest is the overture to a planned series of detailed papers that will rigorously derive each component of the framework. The proposed roadmap includes papers on:
1.  The Core Mechanism of the Geometric Snap
2.  The Dynamical Rules of the Ledger Boundary (NPR & Finite Focusing)
3.  The Geometric Data Structure of the Ledger (The Infinity Bits)
4.  Falsifiable Signatures: Gravitational Wave Echoes
5.  Cosmological Consequences I: A Dark Matter Candidate
6.  Cosmological Consequences II: A Mechanism for Dark Energy
7.  The Microscopic Ledger: A Holographic Tensor Network Model
8.  The Master Action and Path Integral of the Framework
