**Release Title:** `v1.1.0-manifest`: The Priority Compilation

**Release Description:**

This is the inaugural public release of the **Dimensional Collapse Theory of Quantum Gravity (DCT-QG)** framework.

This release contains the **Priority Compilation**, a comprehensive, high-level technical document that establishes the core principles, key equations, and falsifiable predictions of the theory. This manifest serves as the foundational charter for a forthcoming series of detailed papers.

### Core Concepts Introduced:

*   **Dimensional Collapse Theory (DCT):** The central postulate that spacetime dimensionality is a dynamic quantity that reduces from `D -> D-2` at a universal curvature threshold.
*   **The Ledger (`L`):** The physical, 2-dimensional boundary that replaces the classical singularity and acts as an information repository.
*   **Null-Pair Removal (NPR):** The geometric mechanism of the dimensional snap.
*   **The Law of Transdimensional Thermodynamics (TDT):** The thermodynamic principle that governs the ledger's information capacity and fixes the normalization of gravity.
*   **The Infinity Bits (`{b_r, X, Y, Z, W}`):** The minimal, boost-invariant geometric record that ensures the reversibility of the snap.
*   **Phenomenological Predictions:** A framework for gravitational wave echoes, a dark matter candidate from ledger remnants, and a mechanism for dark energy.

### Files in this Release:

*   `Priority_Manifest_v1.1.pdf` - The primary document for reading and citation.
*   `Priority_Manifest_v1.1.tex` - The full LaTeX source.

### Provenance and Verification:

*   **Commit Hash:** `[Paste the full commit hash of this release here]`
*   **PDF SHA-256 Checksum:** `[Run 'sha256sum Priority_Manifest_v1.1.pdf' and paste the hash here]`

This document represents the culmination of a multi-year independent research effort. It is being made publicly available to establish priority and invite scrutiny from the theoretical physics community.
